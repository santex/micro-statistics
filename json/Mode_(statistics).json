{"cursor":"20338","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'mode' is the value that appears most often in a set of data.\n\nLike the statistical mean and median, the mode is a way of expressing, in a\nsingle number, important information about a random variable or a population.\nThe numerical value of the mode is the same as that of the mean and median in a\nnormal distribution, and it may be very different in highly skewed\ndistributions.\n\nThe mode is not necessarily unique, since the same maximum frequency may be\nattained at different values. The most extreme case occurs in uniform\ndistributions, where all values occur equally frequently.\n\nThe mode of a discrete probability distribution is the value x at which its\nprobability mass function takes its maximum value. In other words, it is the\nvalue that is most likely to be sampled.\n\nThe mode of a continuous probability distribution is the value x at which its\nprobability density function has its maximum value, so, informally speaking, the\nmode is at the peak.\n\nAs noted above, the mode is not necessarily unique, since the probability mass\nfunction or probability density function may take the same maximum value at\nseveral points x 1, x 2, etc.\n\nThe above definition tells us that only global maxima are modes. Slightly\nconfusingly, when a probability density function has multiple local maxima it is\ncommon to refer to all of the local maxima as modes of the distribution. Such a\ncontinuous distribution is called multimodal (as opposed to unimodal).\n\nIn symmetric unimodal distributions, such as the normal (or Gaussian)\ndistribution (the distribution whose density function, when graphed, gives the\nfamous \"bell curve\"), the mean (if defined), median and mode all coincide. For\nsamples, if it is known that they are drawn from a symmetric distribution, the\nsample mean can be used as an estimate of the population mode.\n","linknr":492,"url":"Mode_(statistics)","recorded":1362552157,"links":56,"instances":["mathematics","statistics","mathematics","mathematics","discrete","geometry","mathematics","korean_name"],"pdf":["http://www.se16.info/hgb/mode.pdf","http://www.biostat.umn.edu/ftp/pub/2000/rr2000-007.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/bayes-an/9504001.pdf"],"categories":["Means","Summary statistics"],"headings":["Mode of a sample","Comparison of mean, median and mode","van Zwet condition","Unimodal distributions","Confidence interval for the mode with a single data point","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/2/7/6271277b0309a588eed47ee6ee2257a6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/7/c/17c68e294ba0dc1356295bac633bf868.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Comparison_mean_median_mode.svg/300px-Comparison_mean_median_mode.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/1/b/c1b1787773004e5f13adf6e45385443f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/7/9/b79aa3f6efaf064b9acc0355bc4d73b9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/c/b/bcbbb13eaa014ad16a23aaebf81aab0d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/b/c/cbcd495a6b0b4af8859454fd721a1724.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/4/2/d42620e2567066d58e16102831257810.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/3/9/4399d38e10d3979b9fe914f3df95bf63.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/c/9/1c9a9d402f7f5c4736306251bf474273.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/9/7/9975c96a8156817e396c792b3872af4c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/2/8/d287ac7b62fee7f3cf28f03b103b5945.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/6/d/36dad97f0095ee839b3d5e1998ffedb1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/d/8/1d8c5ef65f182e164b669e8d59fc6802.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/c/3/cc34b8f5827b85c95b88d3bf114c8210.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/f/3/1f3a6cab6c5f295b8940aa4d1d22b0df.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/c/0/dc01f9a82d201467439aa624c99c74bd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Fisher_iris_versicolor_sepalwidth.svg/32px-Fisher_iris_versicolor_sepalwidth.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["population","statistics"],["uniform_distribution","discrete"],["interval","mathematics"],["kim","korean_name"],["plane","mathematics"],["centerpoint","geometry"],["pathological","mathematics"],["moment","mathematics"]],"members":["pathological","population","plane","moment","uniform_distribution","centerpoint","interval","kim"],"related":["Mean","Median","Random_variable","Population_(statistics)","Normal_distribution","Uniform_distribution_(discrete)","Discrete_probability_distribution","Probability_mass_function","Continuous_probability_distribution","Probability_density_function","Local_maximum","Multimodal_distribution","Unimodal_distribution","Reflection_symmetry","Normal_distribution","Bimodal","Multimodal_distribution","Interval_(mathematics)","Histogram","Kernel_density_estimation","MATLAB","GNU_Octave","Average","Arithmetic_mean","Median","Nominal_data","Numerical","Korean_name","Kim_(Korean_name)","Vector_space","Real_number","Dimension","Integer","Plane_(mathematics)","Linear_order","Geometric_median","Centerpoint_(geometry)","Pathological_(mathematics)","Cantor_distribution","Affine_transformation","Monotonic","Outliers","Unimodal_distribution","Karl_Pearson","Skewness","Distribution_of_wealth","Median","Log-normal_distribution","Skewness","Log-normal_distribution","Standard_deviation","Log-normal_distribution","Robert_Machol","Karl_Pearson","Unimodal_function","Summary_statistics","Descriptive_statistics","Central_tendency","Mean","Median","Arg_max","Moment_(mathematics)"]}
