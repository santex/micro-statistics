Two\nadvantages of sampling are that the cost is lower and data collection is faster.\n\nEach observation measures one or more properties (such as weight, location,\ncolor) of observable bodies distinguished as independent objects or individuals.\nIn survey sampling, weights can be applied to the data to adjust for the sample\ndesign, particularly stratified sampling (blocking). Results from probability\ntheory and statistical theory are employed to guide practice. In business and\nmedical research, sampling is widely used for gathering information about a\npopulation.\n\nThe sampling process comprises several stages:\n* Defining the population of concern\n* Specifying a sampling frame, a set of items or events possible to measure\n* Specifying a sampling method for selecting items or events from the frame\n* Determining the sample size\n* Implementing the sampling plan\n* Sampling and data collecting\n","linknr":649,"url":"Sampling_(statistics)","recorded":1362539076,"links":48,"instances":["statistics","statistics","statistics","statistics","case_studies","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www.springerlink.com/content/u272h22kx2124037/fulltext.pdf"],"categories":["Sampling (statistics)|","Survey methodology"],"headings":["Population definition","Sampling frame","Probability and nonprobability sampling","Sampling methods","Replacement of selected units","Sample size","Sampling and data collection","Errors in sample surveys","Survey weights","History","See also","Notes","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Fisher_iris_versicolor_sepalwidth.svg/32px-Fisher_iris_versicolor_sepalwidth.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/WMFstratplanSurvey1.png/120px-WMFstratplanSurvey1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["population","statistics"],["sample","statistics"],["blocking","statistics"],["set","mathematics"],["replication","statistics"],["sample","statistics"],["sampling","case_studies"]],"members":["population","replication","blocking","sample","sampling","set"],"related":["Statistics","Statistical_survey","Population_(statistics)","Observation","Survey_sampling","Sample_(statistics)","Stratified_sampling","Blocking_(statistics)","Probability_theory","Statistical_theory","Set_(mathematics)","Statistical_population","Batch_production","Joseph_Jagger","Roulette","Monte_Carlo","Probability_distribution","Electrical_conductivity","Copper","Cause_system","Sampling_frame","Opinion_poll","Electoral_register","Telephone_directory","Simple_random_sample","Systematic_sampling","Stratified_Sampling","Cluster_sampling","Multistage_sampling","Selection_bias","Accidental_sampling","Quota_sampling","Purposive_sampling","Systematic_sampling","Randomization","Probability_sampling","Stratified_sampling","Databases","Sampling_bias","Poisson_sampling","Sampling_frame","Cluster_sampling","Multistage_sampling","Mutually_exclusive","Stratified_sampling","Random","Accidental_sampling","Snowball_sampling","Paul_Lazarsfeld","Political_campaign","Longitudinal_study","Panel_data","MANOVA","Growth_curves","Structural_equation_modeling","University_of_Alberta","Canada","Sample_size","Survey_sampling","Laplace","Ratio_estimator","Confidence_interval","Bayes'_theorem","Prior_probability","Alexander_Ivanovich_Chuprov","Imperial_Russia","U.S._presidential_election,_1936","Bias","Acceptance_sampling","Data_collection","Official_statistics","Ratio_estimator","Replication_(statistics)","Sample_(statistics)","Sampling_(case_studies)","Sampling_error","Gy's_sampling_theory","Horvitz–Thompson_estimator","Cognitive_psychology","Robert_M._Groves","Statistical_theory","David_S._Moore","William_Gemmell_Cochran","Carl-Erik_Särndal","Institute_for_Social_Research","University_of_Michigan","Dover_Publications","Leslie_Kish","W._Edwards_Deming","Journal_of_the_Royal_Statistical_Society","Journal_of_the_Royal_Statistical_Society","Biometrika","David_R._Cox","MIL-STD-105"]}
