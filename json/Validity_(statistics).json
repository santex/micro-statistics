{"cursor":"25144","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn science and statistics, 'validity' is the extent to which a concept,\nconclusion or measurement is well-founded and corresponds accurately to the real\nworld. The word \"valid\" is derived from the Latin validus, meaning strong. The\nvalidity of a measurement tool (for example, a test in education) is considered\nto be the degree to which the tool measures what it claims to measure.\n\nIn psychometrics, validity has a particular application known as test validity:\n\"the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test\nscores\" (\"as entailed by proposed uses of tests\"). American Educational\nResearch Association, Psychological Association, & National Council on\nMeasurement in Education. (1999). [[Standards for Educational and Psychological\nTesting]]. Washington, DC: American Educational Research Association.\n\nIn the area of scientific research design and experimentation, validity refers\nto whether a study is able to scientifically answer the questions it is intended\nto answer.\n\nIn clinical fields, the assessment of validity of a diagnosis and various\ndiagnostic tests are extremely important. As diagnosis augments treatments,\nmedications, and the patient's life, it is extremely important to know that\nwhen running diagnostic tests that clinicians are truly testing what they\nintend to test.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the concept of scientific validity addresses the\nnature of reality and as such is an epistemological and philosophical issue as\nwell as a question of measurement. The use of the term in logic is narrower,\nrelating to the truth of inferences made from premises.\n\nValidity is important because it can help determine what types of tests to use,\nand help to make sure researchers are using methods that are not only ethical,\nand cost-effective, but also a method that truly measures the idea or construct\nin question.\n","linknr":266,"url":"Validity_(statistics)","recorded":1362480360,"links":29,"instances":["statistics","research","logic","disambiguation","medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.hsrc.ac.za/research/output/outputDocuments/1716_Foxcroft_Psychologicalassessmentin%20SA.pdf","http://www.all-about-forensic-psychology.com/support-files/the-precarious-use-of-forensic-psychology-as-evidence.pdf","http://www.all-about-forensic-psychology.com/support-files/the-precarious-use-of-forensic-psychology-as-evidence.pdf"],"categories":["Philosophy of science","Psychometrics","Educational psychology","Validity (statistics)|"],"headings":["Test validity","Experimental validity","Diagnostic validity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Reliability_and_validity.svg/220px-Reliability_and_validity.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["validity","logic"],["reliability","statistics"],["variable","research"],["screening","medicine"],["validation","disambiguation"]],"members":["reliability","variable","validity","validation","screening"],"related":["Science","Statistics","Psychometrics","Test_validity","Research_design","Experimentation","Medical_diagnosis","Diagnostic_tests","Epistemological","Philosophical","Measurement","Validity_(logic)","Reliability_(statistics)","Classical_test_theory","Correlation","Construct_validity","Convergent_validity","Content_validity","Representation_validity","Face_validity","Malleus_Malificarum","Brian_Levack","Anne_Lewellyn_Barstow","Criterion_validity","Concurrent_validity","Predictive_validity","Scientific_method","Research_ethics","Statistical_conclusion_validity","Variable_(research)","Internal_validity","Inductive_reasoning","Independent_variable","Dependent_variable","Confounding","External_validity","Ecological_validity","Empiricism","Falsifiability","Medicine","Screening_(medicine)","Laboratory","Sensitivity_and_specificity","False_negative","False_positive","Psychiatry","Classification_of_mental_disorders","Feighner_Criteria","Research_Diagnostic_Criteria","Nancy_Coover_Andreasen","Molecular_genetics","Molecular_biology","Neurochemistry","Neuroanatomy","Neurophysiology","Cognitive_neuroscience","Neural_substrate","Utility","Hereditary","Essentialist","Gene","Daubert_v._Merrell_Dow_Pharmaceuticals","Concurrent_validity","Content_validity","Construct_validity","External_validity","Face_validity","Internal_validity","Predictive_validity","Statistical_conclusion_validity","Validity","Validation_(disambiguation)"]}
